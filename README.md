# CROP-PREDICTION
CROP PREDICTION DESCRIPTION
🌾 Crop Prediction using Deep Learning (Python + TensorFlow)
This project predicts the most suitable crop based on environmental conditions such as Rainfall, Temperature, and pH using a neural network. It's built using TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and pandas, and includes data visualization and model evaluation.

🚀 Features
📊 Uses real-world agricultural data for training

🧠 Built on a neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras

✅ One-hot encoding for multi-class classification of crops

📈 Visualization of:

Rainfall vs Temperature

Training vs Validation Accuracy

💾 Saves trained model as .h5 for deployment/inference

🧪 Tech Stack
Python 3

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

Scikit-learn (for data preprocessing)

TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning model)

📁 Project Workflow
Load Dataset – Load crop data with features: Rainfall, Temperature, pH

Preprocessing – Normalize input and one-hot encode crop labels

EDA – Visualize environmental data

Model Training – Neural network with 3 layers

Evaluation – Accuracy on test data + training curves

Model Saving – Export trained model as crop_prediction_model.h5
